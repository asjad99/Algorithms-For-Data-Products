4. Automatic Recommendation of Pythonic Idiom Usage - https://youtu.be/vOCQReSvBxA
5. Using machine learning for code recommendation : https://ai.facebook.com/blog/aroma-ml-for-code-recommendation/
6. Deep learning to translate between programming languages https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deep-learning-to-translate-between-programming-languages/
7. More broadly, AI has the potential to help with other programming tasks. 
For example, Facebook AI has previously shared Neural Code Search, a method for using natural language in queries about code, and Getafix, 
a tool that learns to automatically suggest fixes for coding bugs. 
8. Introducing TF-Coder, a tool that writes tricky TensorFlow expressions for you!
