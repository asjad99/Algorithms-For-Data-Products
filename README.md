### Data Science

> Data products provide actionable information without exposing decision makers to the underlying data or analytics (e.g., buy/sell strategies for fnancial instruments, a set of actions to improve product yield, or steps to improve product marketing).

 > Data Science is the art of turning data into actions. Tis is accomplished through the creation of data products, which provide actionable information without exposing decision makers to the underlying data or analytics (e.g., buy/sell strategies for fnancial instruments, a set of actions to improve product yield, or steps to improve product marketing). Performing Data Science requires the extraction of timely, actionable information from diverse data sources to drive data products. Examples of data products include answers to questions such as: “Which of my products should I advertise more heavily to increase proft? How can I improve my compliance program, while reducing costs? What manufacturing process change will allow me to build a better product?” Te key to answering these questions is: understand the data you have and what the data inductively tells you.

Examples include: Movie Recommendations, Weather Forecasts, Stock Market Predictions, Production Process Improvements 
- Health Diagnosis
- Flu Trend Predictions 
- Targeted Advertising 

### The art of Formulating a  question/hypothesis:

#### The Art of Story telling: Case Studies: 

The goal of your analysis is to tell an actionable story. Following project illustrate this:

- Predicting Spatial Risk of Opioid Overdoses in Providence, RI
- Tidying and mapping Toronto open data
- Where to live in the US
- Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half
